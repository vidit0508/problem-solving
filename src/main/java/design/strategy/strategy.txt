STRATEGY

This patten is ideal to use when we have multiple child which are inheriting the same parent
class. BUT instead of using the parent class functionality they want to implement their own specific
implementation.

NOW the problem arises that what if multiple child classes are implementing same functionality in the
same way then this problem leads to code redundancy because two child classes now have the same exact
implementation.
