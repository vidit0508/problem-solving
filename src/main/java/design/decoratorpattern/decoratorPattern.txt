In decorator pattern, we have one base object which has its own properties and features (F1). Now, to add more
functionality to this base object we will wrap this around the decorator with more functionality (F1 + F2).


Use cases
1. Like in pizza shop, where you create a base pizza and then add we will decorate with
topping on it like extra cheese, extra topping, jalepeno.

Why we need this decorator pattern?
Because of the scenario of class explosion where you might need to create multiple Classes as per permutations.
